rewrite locations and roles
OPTIONAL BUT PROBABLY GOOD IDEAS:
- add fill bucket to drawing

Design promotional popup for paid version
MAKE VERY APPEALING
- Video showing off new locations packs
- Video showing off custom locations
NO SCROLLING - TOO MUCH OF A BARRIER TO PURCHASE
Create text popup if purchasing is unavailable - handled in IAPManager
Tweak popup tweening

Build to iphone and test IOS specifics
- are purchases remembered after uninstall and reinstall - they should, unless I have to read Apple Store reciept specifically (not sure how to test)

Final touches:
Make sure all locations have images
Reset game to free version
Disable test mode for ads in Unity Dashboard
Make sure all controls are configured for iOS
Finalize Monetization page of Unity Dashboard - ex. Add store ID

Create app store graphics

"Pass and Play Spyfall"
- customizeable game settings
- over x locations and over x roles
- create your own custom locations
- instructions
- automatic scoring
- 3+ Players
- Social deception game
- fun fact: there's a spy hidden in every location image, can you find them all?
